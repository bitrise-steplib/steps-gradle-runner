        Using a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is required, as the wrapper is what makes sure
        that the right Gradle version is installed and used for the build.

        __You can find more information about the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew),
        and about how you can generate one (if you would not have one already)__
        in the official guide at: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

        **The path should be relative** to the repository root, for example: `./gradlew`,
        or if it's in a sub directory: `./sub/dir/gradlew`.

        The step will copy the generated apk files that match this filter into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

        This filter is a standard find commands -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

        If you specify an empty filter, the step will set this filter to: `*.apk`.

        Example:

        - `*release*.apk` - Copy every apk which filename contains `release`, like (`./app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk`).

        One filter per line. The step will **not** copy the generated apk files that match this filters into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.
        You can use this filter to avoid moving unalinged and/or unsigned apk files.

        This filter is a standard find commands negated -path flag, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

        If you specify an empty filter, every apk file (selected by `apk_file_include_filter`) will be copied.

        Example:

        - `*unaligned*.apk` - Avoid to copy apk if filename contains `unaligned`.
